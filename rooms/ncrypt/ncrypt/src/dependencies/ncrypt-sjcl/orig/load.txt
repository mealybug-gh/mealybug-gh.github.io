The 'sjcl' folder is created running
'git clone https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl',
i.e. by just cloning the 'sjcl' repository.
Another way would be to install the 'sjcl' module and move it to this folder.

Then, copy the folder 'core' to the top folder (parent folder of this folder)
and rename it to 'src'. This will be used for builds and this is where changes
take place.
